## Notes

- use `ADD` instead of `INSTALL`

## Start

- go to root folder and enter commands below

`npm install --save`
`chmod +x cli.js`
`npm install -g`

## Blockers and Room to Improve

- Recursive search was causing problems(some files not installing or removing chain files), function changed to closest possible

- `requiredBy` type in packages.json is buggy, could be improved
